# Snakes-Game
Worms like game: PvP, shoot projectiles at your opponent and modify power and angle to aim. Turn based, rely on physics/gravity and have a variety of projectiles that affect the players and terrain/map. Players can move on their turn(limited amount) and either have an hp that goes down on hit, or a score that increases as they hit the enemy. Weapons are either randomized or selected from a randomized pool before the match, so players donâ€™t just spam one weapon.

Shinji work log:

5/23/22: Made a little bit of projectile and started the project. Got projectile to display itself and do the physics/move.

5/24/22: Made projectile orient itself correctly and changed some of partner code.

5/25/22: Made methods to changed the terrain and made a lot of changes to older code for future methods

5/26/22: Added collision detection to projectiles and made the scanEffectRadius() method, which is called after colliding with terrain and interacts with the appropriate terrain in its radius. Also added a DirtShot projectile that creates terrain. scanEffectRadius doesn't currently do anything with snakes, but it will later and should be easy to code the extra stuff.

5/27/22: Worked on the beginning of buttons

5/29/22: Finished buttons and did a lot of bug/error fixing for issues caused by the new changes made in the code and from merges.

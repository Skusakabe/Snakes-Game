# Snakes-Game
Worms like game: PvP, shoot projectiles at your opponent and modify power and angle to aim. Turn based, rely on physics/gravity and have a variety of projectiles that affect the players and terrain/map. Players can move on their turn(limited amount) and either have an hp that goes down on hit, or a score that increases as they hit the enemy. Weapons are either randomized or selected from a randomized pool before the match, so players donâ€™t just spam one weapon.
